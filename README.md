# SinglyLinkedList
DataStructure

An easy implementation of a Singly Linked List.

Pros:
  - Uses less memory;
  - Sempler implementation;

Cons:
  - Cannot easily access previous elements;

This implementation contains:

  - Deleting O(n);
  - Insertion at the beggining O(1);
  - Insertion at the end O(1);
  - Getting the first element/node O(1);
  - Getting the last element/node O(1);
  - Removing the first node O(1);
  - Removing the last node O(1);
  - Remove a given node from list O(n);
  - Remove a node at a given position O(n);
  - Returning the index of a node O(n);
  - Checking if a node is in list O(n);
  - Returning a node by it's index O(n);
  - Insert at a node at a given position O(n);
  - Print O(n);
  - Reversing O(n);

There are other methods of implementation but the idea is the same.
